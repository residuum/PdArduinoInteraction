**Due to Github's determination to be the "worldâ€™s leading AI-powered developer platform" I will move my projects to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Residuum)**

Arduino Interaction with Pd for Live Performance
------------------------------------------------

My Pd patch for performing live, using Pd as sample and MIDI recorder
and looper. A lot of the stuff can be triggered by external buttons
and a force sensitive resistor.

On the Pd side you will need:
- Some of my abstractions from 
  https://github.com/residuum/Puredata-abstractions
- Some libraries: comport, list-abs

Description and photos of the project can be found at 
http://ix.residuum.org/pd/arduino.html

The circuit diagram is made with gSchem from gEDA 
(http://geda-project.org/).
